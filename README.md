# Python_Assignment
Files that are in this Repository include:
1. Python_project_notebook.ipynb = main jupyter notebook with code
2. Sample.txt = sample nucleotide sequence used to check parts of code
3. Bears_mass_cytb.csv = file with proportions of the different types of amino acids created in part 8
4. bears_cytb.fasta = given file
5. bears_dara.csv = given file
6. python_translate.py = given file

Throughout the assignment I used these resources to help with understanding BioPython and get information about the bear species:
